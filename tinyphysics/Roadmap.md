Here is the **TinyPhysics Development Roadmap**.

This roadmap is structured by **complexity of the primitives**, not just complexity of the physics. It starts with simple separable Hamiltonians (standard gradients) and progresses to complex geometric structures (Lie algebras) and infinite-dimensional fields (Fluids/Quantum).

* **The "Tiny" Insight:** The 2D Euler equation for fluids is actually just a Lie-Poisson system where the "variables" are the vorticity at every pixel. It uses the exact same solver code as the Rigid Body, just with a bigger matrix!

### **Recommended Progression Path**

If you are coding this alone, follow this strictly linear path to maintain sanity:

1. **Harmonic Oscillator** (Prove the Autograd works).
2. **N-Body Gravity** (Prove the GPU performance works).
3. **Rigid Body Top** (Prove the  structure works).
4. **1D Schrödinger** (Prove the Complex numbers work).
5. **2D Fluid (Vorticity)** (Prove the Scale works).
